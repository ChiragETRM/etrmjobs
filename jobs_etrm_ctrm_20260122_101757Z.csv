**Effect of gamma\\-ray irradiation on ferroelectric, hafnia\\-based, non\\-volatile memory for use in extreme environments**


**Domain, Specialties:** Material physics, surface science


**Keywords:** HfO2, ferroelectricity, radiation hardness, point defects, HAXPES, extreme environments


**Location:** Laboratory for the Study of NanoStructures and Surface Imaging (LENSIS) at CEA Saclay, France


**Type of contract:** PhD offer, expected start date October 2026


**Description**


The emergence of hafnia\\-based ferroelectric (FE) memories \\[Böscke2011] has opened a new paradigm for ultra\\-low\\-power edge computing. Hafnia is fully compatible with CMOS technology \\[Trentzsch2017], can be aggressively scaled \\[Martin2024], offers low access latency (\\~ns), and requires \\~fJ/bit to switch—three orders of magnitude less than other emerging non\\-volatile memories. These properties make FE memories ideally suited for smart edge systems, overcoming the memory wall while enabling secure local data processing. Advanced 1T\\-1C FeRAM architectures, where the FeCAP is connected to the drain of a CMOS transistor, also provide promising paths toward NVDRAM \\[Micron2024] and NVSRAM \\[Okuno2025]. Moreover, hafnia is a by\\-product of the French nuclear industry giving France and Europe a major strategic advantage in global supply compared to China. These advantages align with strategic applications in space, defense, medical, nuclear safety, and heavy\\-duty transport, where electronics face harsh radiation environments. For example, space missions endure continuous radiation exposure for 5–15 years (hundreds of krad/year for ESA’s JUICE mission \\[Furano2012]), in addition to sporadic solar flare spikes. On\\-board systems must thus tolerate both steady\\-state and transient radiation doses with reliability far beyond that of consumer\\-grade devices. In this context, ultra\\-low\\-power FE logic and memory—especially in FD\\-SOI SoC implementations—could deliver up to 3× lower payload and 10× lower power consumption, while maintaining the non\\-volatile and radiation\\-hard performance required for space, defense, and nuclear applications.


Nevertheless, stable imprint behavior still remains a significant challenge \\[Mikolajick2021]. Imprint induces a shift of the Polarization\\-Voltage (P\\-V) curve along the voltage axis \\[Alhada2025] as shown in Fig. 2 and is attributed to charge trapping/detrapping, FE domain pinning and concentration profile of charged defects. All may be accentuated under irradiation. The seminal paper of Lucovsky et al. demonstrated that the key point defect is the VO, which provides both shallow and deep charge traps, enhanced by g\\- and X\\-ray radiation \\[Lucovsky2006]. First detailed DFT calculations confirmed the nature of the traps at VO \\[Xiong2005]. Incident radiation creates e\\-h pairs as suggested in Fig. 1, which can then be swept to either electrode depending on the internal field or applied bias.

  


*Figure 1\\. (left) Schematic of the formation of shallow and deep trap states at oxygen vacancies and possible charge states (0 and 2\\+) (right) Co60 sources at LABRA CEA Saclay*


Ding et al reported trapped charged following generation of e\\-h pairs under g\\-ray radiation \\[Ding2021]. Kaya et al studied the effect of g\\-radiation up to 5 MRad demonstrating a high threshold voltage shift in HfO2 MOSFETs.

  


*Figure 2\\. (Left) Phase field modelling of P\\-V imprint(blue) compared with experimental results (red) \\[Alhada2025] (right) Schematic of HAXPES geometry allowing operando VO quantification as a function of cycling conditions and bias.*
Radiation enhanced diffusion of defects in solids is a long\\-standing historical problem, originating in the need to characterize nuclear materials \\[Dienes1958]. Charged VO may drift under the internal polarization field in addition to the classic diffusion problem represented by Fick’s law leading to diffusion enhancement. Furthermore, VO diffusion to electrode/ferroelectric interfaces may be self\\-limiting, resulting in accumulation of VO in the bulk film. Trapped charge at the electrode/ferroelectric interface may further limit drift, resulting in the accumulation of excess charge in the bulk. Modest γ\\-radiation can degrade FeCAP polarization \\[Zhang2020], however, the reported resilience metrics do not include FeRAM at the memory array\\-level with large statistical data collection.


**The correlation of radiation induced changes in V****O** **concentration with electrical performance is an open question which will be addressed in this thesis work.**


The project will use advanced photoelectron spectroscopy techniques including synchrotron radiation induced Hard X\\-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and complementary structural analysis including high\\-resolution electron microscopy, X\\-ray diffraction and near field microscopy. Using appropriate, low energy, ion beam etching and angular dependence of the XPS, the electrode/ferroelectric interfaces will be studied following the methods we have already developed \\[Hamouda2020, Hamouda2022]. Hard X\\-ray photoemission (HAXPES) using synchrotron radiation will be used to probe the interface chemistry and band alignment in FeCAP in a non\\-destructive manner (Fig. 2 (right)).

  


##### *Figure 3\\.* *Inelastic mean free path of electrons as a function of kinetic energy. The darker rectangle represents the domain covered by laboratory XPS systems. The larger, light blue rectangle represents the HAXPES regime up to 8 keV photon energy.*

  


We will design samples with suitable geometry (Fig. 2\\) for *operando* measurements of the interface band line\\-ups as a function of the applied bias Operando experiments


There are two specific objectives to the thesis work:


 * Gamma radiation effects on HfxZr1\\-xO2 (HZO) material properties. Radiation induced orthorhombic to tetragonal/monoclinic/antipolar phase transitions. Generation and transport of mobile charge electron\\-hole pairs, charge trapping/de\\-trapping, enhanced VO mobility. Radiation induced point defects including VO and VHf. Radiation enhanced diffusion.
  


* Quantification of FE device properties in HZO\\-based FeCAPs as a function of radiation dose. Outcome of the characterization will be exploited to develop and calibrate FeCAP compact models to be used at the circuit level.



The results will be compared to circuit level characterization of irradiation effect on wafer level and packaged 1T\\-1C 16kb and 512kb HZO\\-based FeRAMs, respectively. Circuit/system level simulations of irradiation. Quantification of radiation sensitivity of peripheral circuits and underlying CMOS


FeCAP fields and FeRAM circuit integrated onto 130nm CMOS test vehicles will be fabricated at CEA/Leti, Grenoble. The first task will focus on understanding the radiation induced changes in ferroelectric properties of FeCAPs. The second task will focus on the characterization of FeRAM circuit integrated on 200mm test vehicles with high statistics (at least 16kb).


The irradiations will be done at LABRA (CEA DRF) using the PAGURE irradiator allowing controlled irradiations up to 472 Gy/hr. Three campaigns are foreseen in the project, allowing to study in parallel the modifications of material properties, the FeCAP behaviour and the FeRAM and peripheral circuit response to gamma irradiation. The irradiation campaign spacing will also allow material or processing optimization between runs.


The physical and chemical analysis will be done in laboratory and synchrotron environments. X\\-ray and ultra violet photoelectron spectroscopy will be carried out at CEA Saclay. Hard X\\-ray photoemission using synchrotron radiation (Soleil, Petra\\-III, NSLS\\-2, Spring\\-8\\) will allow probing the VO concentration profile in FeCAPs \\[Iung2025, Yadav2025] after irradiation. XRD will probe the phase composition as a function of dose and cycling.


At each level, the experimental material and electrical characterization will be accompanied by theoretical calculations to simulate the material response to irradiation and compact modelling of the resulting device performance (collaboration with the Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon).


The PhD project will be carried out in the framework of a close collaboration between the CEA/Leti in Grenoble providing the samples, integrated devices and wafer scale characterization and the CEA/Iramis in Saclay for the fundamental analysis of the material properties, irradiation experiments and device scale characterizations.

**Job Description:**

The **Credit Data Analytics Lead** reports to the Global Market Risk Manager. This will be a senior role tasked with leading the transformation of Credit Risk Analytics activities in partnership with the Global Credit Analytics Team Lead and the Credit Risk Transformation team.

In doing so the position holder will help ensure delivery of our transformation journey through delivery of enhanced data and analytics in a platform which is clean, accurate and available in timely and digestible format.

A key facet of this role is finding ways to present this information to the internal stakeholders in a way that's both meaningful (getting us to “So what?”) and easy to digest.


In\\-depth knowledge of the energy industry combined with a successful track record on how risks should be identified, collated, and presented will be critical. By building data sets that will help us accurately assess risks that may become a reality without intervention by the organization, you will be a central part of the Risk team. The role requires someone that will think outside the box, envisioning both internal and external risks and related analyses that might be otherwise unnoticeable to others in the organization.

**Rethink how energy trading platforms are built, owned, and evolved.**

At InCommodities US, we’re building a modern EnergyTech platform to support trading across power, gas, and renewables. As we scale our physical and financial trading activities, our ETRM platform is mission\\-critical. That’s where you come in.

We’re looking for a Senior ETRM Platform Product Owner to take full ownership of our ETRM as a product – from selection and implementation to long\\-term operation and evolution. This is not a project coordination role. You’ll be the accountable owner, making clear decisions, setting boundaries, and ensuring the platform supports the business without creating platform debt.

**What you’ll do**

* You own the ETRM platform strategy and target operating model across trading, operations, risk, and finance
* You lead the ETRM selection process with a platform\\-first mindset, focusing on APIs, data models, and integration maturity – not demo theatre
* You drive vendor and system integrator engagement, including structured demos and technical proof\\-of\\-capability
* You define and enforce clear system\\-of\\-record principles – what data lives where, and why
* You own scope boundaries and backlog decisions: what belongs in the ETRM, external services, or third\\-party tools
* You partner closely with architecture and engineering to define integration contracts, identifiers, reconciliation patterns, and observability standards
* You lead scenario\\-based UAT, defect triage, and go\\-live readiness
* You ensure strong controls are built in from day one: permissions, auditability, segregation of duties, and operational resilience
* You own the platform post go\\-live, including change governance, release cadence, adoption, and data quality

**Your Team**

You’ll work at the intersection of trading, market operations, risk, finance, and technology. You won’t do this alone – but you will be the one accountable for outcomes. Expect close collaboration with solution architects, engineers, traders, and external vendors, in a flat organization where clear decision\\-making matters.

**What you bring**

* You have 7\\+ years of experience with energy trading systems or ETRMs, with true ownership responsibility
* You bring hands\\-on experience supporting natural gas trading and physical workflows end to end
* You understand gas scheduling and logistics concepts such as nominations, actualizations, imbalances, storage, and capacity constraints
* You’ve made – and defended – clear boundary decisions between ETRM, external services, and third\\-party tools
* You’re comfortable leading cross\\-functional delivery from requirements to go\\-live
* You’re technically literate and able to evaluate APIs, data models, integration patterns, and configuration vs. customization trade\\-offs
* You challenge assumptions, push for evidence, and make solid decisions under uncertainty
* You are well versed in scripting and automation (Python, PowerShell, Bash) to eliminate operational toil
* You still write infrastructure code daily and are comfortable debugging Terraform, fixing pipelines, troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters
* You have been the ""go\\-to person"" for critical production issues, not just the escalation point
* You have a proven track record leading datacenter\\-to\\-cloud migrations or hybrid infrastructure transitions

**How you work**

* You value evidence over opinions and expect vendors to prove capabilities
* You’re pragmatic and focused on shipping value without creating long\\-term platform debt
* You communicate clearly across technical and business stakeholders
* You take ownership and follow decisions through

**What you can expect from us:**

You can expect a role with real influence, high expectations, and the freedom to shape how a critical trading platform is built and run. We offer a competitive compensation package, a flat and trust\\-based organization, and the chance to rethink how ETRM platforms support modern energy trading – not just today, but long term.

If you’re ready to own a platform that truly matters, we’d like to hear from you.

Benefits:

* Flexible working hours and hybrid work schedule
* Medical, Dental, Vision, STD, LTD, Life insurance, all with employer contributions
* 401k with employer matching
* Parental leave including paid and unpaid options
* Generous PTO policy and paid holidays
* Monthly Door Dash allowance and snacks and drinks at the office
* Optional cellphone reimbursement
