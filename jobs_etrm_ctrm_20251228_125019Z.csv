**The team**

The Energy \\& Emissions Excellence (EEE) team, part of SLR’s Energy Advisory practice, provides advisory and implementation support services to energy offtakers, developers and investors. The role is part of a European wide team that collaborates across offices in Europe (and globally) on a daily basis.


With a strong track record of working with multinational organisations, the team delivers business value and impact to clients by advising on and realizing desired outcomes on energy economics, energy security, and emission management across clients’ operations and supply chains. The transition levers addressed include energy management, electrification, renewables, low\\-carbon fuels \\& feedstocks, green heat, low\\-carbon fleet, carbon sinks as well as waste\\-to\\-energy. In Europe, the priority sectors include food \\& beverage, consumer products, life sciences, metals \\& materials, chemicals, glass \\& ceramics, paper \\& pulp, and automotive.


The team supports clients from strategy to execution, tailoring services to where they matter most:


* **“Insight \\& foresight”** on carbon footprints, regulation \\& compliance, technologies \\& solutions, and market developments;
* **“Strategy \\& planning”** for target \\& ambition setting, business \\& operating model change, value chain evolutions, technology choices, investment planning, and roadmap \\& program design;
* **“Solution \\& commitment”** including asset concept design, energy system modelling and optimization, energy procurement, solution costing, business case approval, funding, and supplier \\& contract evaluation;
* **“Execution \\& realization”** including tender management, capital raising, and owner’s engineer activities;
* **“Transformation”** such as stakeholder management, change management, capability sourcing, organisation \\& governance change, digitisation, and program management.

**The role**
------------

As a Manager Energy Sourcing \\& Renewables, you take a key role in growing the services and team related to energy sourcing and renewables across Europe and across sectors from business development to project delivery, and practice development.


You advise clients on the following key areas:


* **Energy Sourcing \\& Procurement Strategy** :



	+ Provide intelligence and foresight on markets and regulation, covering an outlook on e.g. price scenarios, grid fees, taxes, market structures, reporting requirements, protocols, and European energy policy \\& regulatory changes.
	+ Formulate and implement tailored energy sourcing strategies across multiple European markets, balancing cost management, decarbonization, and security of supply across different horizons (short to long term).
	+ Identify opportunities for tariff optimization, load management and contract restructuring.
	+ Assess value potential and define strategy to valorize flexibility (storage, demand side management, curtailment) and the role of electricity procurement in its realization.
* **Renewables \\& Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)** :



	+ Assess and define renewables sourcing targets in context of frameworks such as SBTi, RE100, CDP and others.
	+ Evaluate renewables sourcing instruments and options in each market/ jurisdiction, advise on the optimal mix today and in the future, and define corresponding renewable roadmaps.
	+ Lead the full lifecycle of renewable energy tenders (on\\-site, off\\-site and vPPAs): defining requirements, preparing RFPs/RFQs, evaluating suppliers, and managing selection processes.
	+ Support clients to structure, negotiate, and close corporate PPAs covering different pricing models, underlying scope (wind, solar, possibly co\\-located storage), and innovative contracting aspects.
	+ Advise on renewable certificate and carbon offset management.
* **Risk Management \\& Budget Oversight** :



	+ Advise on the energy risk management model (price volatility, regulatory shifts, supplier dependencies) and provide recommendations on hedging strategy and instruments.
	+ Strengthen (digital) capabilities to monitor, analyse, forecast and report on energy expenditures and performance against budget at the portfolio level, including energy \\& sustainability reporting needs.
* **Transformation \\& Digital Enablement** :



	+ Translate strategies into required operating model changes to enable their execution, covering processes, organization and governance, (digital) capabilities, data \\& insights. This includes sourcing external capabilities, e.g. through aggregators or flexibility service providers.
	+ Evaluate operating model options on value potential, risk sharing, and implementation cost, and design optimal operating model.
	+ Drive stakeholder alignment and effective change management.
	+ Advise on software capabilities, vendor selection, optimal stack, and integration of 3rd party software capabilities in the Energy Trading \\& Risk Management (ETRM) domain.

Around this scope of activities, you assume following key responsibilities:


* **Business \\& client development** :



	+ Evaluate client needs and market evolutions to identify client opportunities and potential new services.
	+ Support initial conversations with new target clients by providing expertise, sharing project experiences, and qualifying opportunities.
	+ Lead the development of (part of) the proposals related to your scope of activities.
	+ Build relationships at existing clients and on existing projects in order to identify and convert cross\\-selling opportunities.
* **Project delivery:**


	+ Lead projects or workstreams end\\-to\\-end covering project planning, progress management, risk \\& issue management, and project financials.
	+ Build trusted relationships with client stakeholders, manage stakeholder expectations, lead project communication, and perform change management.
	+ Lead the delivery process by defining the methodology and approach, guide the team on task execution, own the project deliverables and client recommendations, and oversee the work performed by Consultants and Analysts.
	+ Facilitate client workshops and steering group meetings.
* **People development:**


	+ Provide daily on\\-the\\-job coaching to project teams.
	+ Provide regular feedback to team members.
	+ Support recruiting of new talent through CV screening \\& interviewing and facilitate onboarding of new hires.
	+ Drive engagement and sense of belonging across the wider EEE team, and support talent retention actions.
	+ Line manager and mentor for Consultants and Analysts, and act as a role model.
* **Practice development:**


	+ Support the development of new offerings (e.g. multi\\-buyer PPA, flexibility proposition).
	+ Drive continuous improvement of methodologies, frameworks, and deliverables.
	+ Support the codification and management of (new) knowledge, and develop and conduct training programs.
	+ Conduct competitive assessments to improve our positioning and differentiation.
	+ Support definition and execution of a team hiring and development plan.

The role is based in Brussels.


The closing date for applications is 31 January 2025\\.

What do we rely on at ENCAVIS? The sun. The wind. And on you.


Welcome to Encavis! Our world is all about the power of the sun, the wind and the more than 400 people across our group who are working together to shape the energy system of the future in order to ensure a sustainable energy supply for future generations.


**ENCAVIS Management GmbH \\& Co. KG** is the holding company of **Elbe BidCo GmbH**, one of Europe's leading electricity producers from renewable energies. We operate a broadly diversified portfolio of over 330 onshore wind farms, ground\\-mounted solar plants and battery storage facilities in 13 European countries with an installed capacity of more than 3\\.8 GW. And best of all, we are continuing to grow! Our subsidiaries, **Stern Energy SpA**, which operates throughout Europe as a specialist in technical services for photovoltaic systems, and **Encavis Asset Management AG,** which specialises in supporting institutional investors, complement our portfolio.

  

What does this mean for you? The opportunity to make a difference, to shape and change things. As part of a multinational team that enjoys helping to make the energy transition a success.


Encavis is building its daughter company Green Energy Supply (GES) into a modern power trading and supply unit that purchases electricity from solar and onshore wind parks and sells to the market and customers, while leveraging also the flexibility of the Encavis Battery Storage Fleet. Your mission is to shape and deliver the systems, processes, and partnerships that make GES reliable, agile, and scalable across European markets.


You will lead the design and delivery of an end‑to‑end operating setup so traders, risk, finance, and compliance can work from a single source of truth. You’ll start with our existing and pragmatic “lightway” trading stack before deciding with us on the next steps.


Your sunny outlook:

* Set the target operating model for GES around a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) backbone and the Asset Ocean data \\& intelligence layer, ensuring fast execution and robust post‑trade controls.
* Deliver a “lightway” trading stack without an ETRM: practical deal capture/journaling, data flows, daily risk \\& P\\&L views, reconciliation, and scheduling/nomination via the VPP—with auditability and clear roles.
* Lead the ETRM evaluation and decision (build/buy/vendor), run proofs of concept, compare options, and define a staged migration plan from lightway to the target ETRM.
* Translate business needs into software requirements: specify data contracts with Asset Ocean (schemas, versioning), APIs/streaming, master data and contract parameters, and quality/latency SLAs that trading can rely on.
* Integrate algorithmic trading partners and in‑house models, with governance: monitoring, guardrails, kill‑switches, and fallback playbooks for safe automation.
Orchestrate front‑to‑back processes (deal nomination risk/P\\&L* settlement), embedding maker/checker controls, segregation of duties, and regulatory reporting (e.g., REMIT/market communications).
* Own the product backlog and delivery cadence: prioritize outcomes, align stakeholders, and manage vendors and partners to measurable results.
* Establish operational excellence: service levels, runbooks, dashboards, and incident management that reduce toil and improve reliability as volumes grow.
* Champion security and compliance: access governance, audit trails, defensible change management, and data protection suited to a trading environment.
* Enable AI‑assisted forecasting/optimization where it adds value—controlled pilots, A/B testing, and clear success criteria.
We'll get wind of that soon:

**Education \\& Background**

* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in **Engineering, Energy/Electrical, Economics/Finance, Business**, or **Information/Data Systems**; **equivalent practical experience** in power trading or trading‑systems product roles is welcome.
* **5\\+ years** in energy/power trading, product management, or front‑to‑back systems delivery or at least **3\\+ years** owning market‑integrated processes (deal nomination risk/P\\&L settlement) across teams.

**Must‑haves**

* Confidence defining **API/streaming/data‑model requirements** and data contracts—no coding required, but clear specification and governance.
* Track record in **product ownership \\& delivery leadership**: roadmaps, PoCs, vendor assessments, and stakeholder alignment.
* Familiarity with **cloud‑native patterns (Azure preferred)** and modern delivery from a product/process perspective.
* **Power BI**, basic **SQL** or **Python** for analysis/validation, reading **API Docs** to review interfaces.
* Proven ownership of **trading or market‑integrated systems**, delivering front‑to‑back processes in power or commodities.
* Experience with **renewables power markets** (day‑ahead/intraday), nominations/scheduling, and portfolio management.
* **Security/compliance mindset** for trading (auditability, SoD, logging/monitoring, regulated reporting such as REMIT).
* Clear, persuasive communication across trading, risk, finance, compliance, and engineering; fluent English.

* Willingness to travel extensively for client meetings, industry conferences, and business development activities across international markets
* Strategic mindset combined with entrepreneurial drive, comfortable working in a dynamic growth environment where you'll influence commercial direction
* Collaborative working style with ability to partner effectively across product, marketing, and leadership functions

**Work Permissions**

You must have the right to work in the United Kingdom. Visa sponsorship is not available at this time.

**What's on offer:**

* Highly competitive base salary £70,000\\-£100,000 DOE with uncapped commission structure

The commodity trading sector represents a significant opportunity for technology professionals who understand both enterprise software sales and domain\\-specific challenges.

\\* Ensure agreed definitions of ready and done are adhered to by the team and external customers.
\\* Identify bottlenecks in the delivery process and take remedial action. Track and analyze cycle time.
\\* Facilitate discussions within the team (such as through retrospectives) to identify options for process improvement.
\\* Handle and mitigate, as needed, relevant risks, issues, dependencies and assumptions.
\\* Escalate where needed in a timely manner.
\\* Bring together innovations, lessons learned and successes and share them to other teams.
\\* Promote a culture of one\\-on\\-one feedback within the team.
\\* Educate team members on agile ways of working, championing ceremonies and ‘being agile’ over ‘doing agile’ or equivalent experience.
