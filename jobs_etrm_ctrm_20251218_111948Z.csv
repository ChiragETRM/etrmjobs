**The team**

The Energy \\& Emissions Excellence (EEE) team, part of SLR’s Energy Advisory practice, provides advisory and implementation support services to energy offtakers, developers and investors. The role is part of a European wide team that collaborates across offices in Europe (and globally) on a daily basis.


With a strong track record of working with multinational organisations, the team delivers business value and impact to clients by advising on and realizing desired outcomes on energy economics, energy security, and emission management across clients’ operations and supply chains. The transition levers addressed include energy management, electrification, renewables, low\\-carbon fuels \\& feedstocks, green heat, low\\-carbon fleet, carbon sinks as well as waste\\-to\\-energy. In Europe, the priority sectors include food \\& beverage, consumer products, life sciences, metals \\& materials, chemicals, glass \\& ceramics, paper \\& pulp, and automotive.


The team supports clients from strategy to execution, tailoring services to where they matter most:


* **“Insight \\& foresight”** on carbon footprints, regulation \\& compliance, technologies \\& solutions, and market developments;
* **“Strategy \\& planning”** for target \\& ambition setting, business \\& operating model change, value chain evolutions, technology choices, investment planning, and roadmap \\& program design;
* **“Solution \\& commitment”** including asset concept design, energy system modelling and optimization, energy procurement, solution costing, business case approval, funding, and supplier \\& contract evaluation;
* **“Execution \\& realization”** including tender management, capital raising, and owner’s engineer activities;
* **“Transformation”** such as stakeholder management, change management, capability sourcing, organisation \\& governance change, digitisation, and program management.

**The role**
------------

As a Manager Energy Sourcing \\& Renewables, you take a key role in growing the services and team related to energy sourcing and renewables across Europe and across sectors from business development to project delivery, and practice development.


You advise clients on the following key areas:


* **Energy Sourcing \\& Procurement Strategy** :



	+ Provide intelligence and foresight on markets and regulation, covering an outlook on e.g. price scenarios, grid fees, taxes, market structures, reporting requirements, protocols, and European energy policy \\& regulatory changes.
	+ Formulate and implement tailored energy sourcing strategies across multiple European markets, balancing cost management, decarbonization, and security of supply across different horizons (short to long term).
	+ Identify opportunities for tariff optimization, load management and contract restructuring.
	+ Assess value potential and define strategy to valorize flexibility (storage, demand side management, curtailment) and the role of electricity procurement in its realization.
* **Renewables \\& Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)** :



	+ Assess and define renewables sourcing targets in context of frameworks such as SBTi, RE100, CDP and others.
	+ Evaluate renewables sourcing instruments and options in each market/ jurisdiction, advise on the optimal mix today and in the future, and define corresponding renewable roadmaps.
	+ Lead the full lifecycle of renewable energy tenders (on\\-site, off\\-site and vPPAs): defining requirements, preparing RFPs/RFQs, evaluating suppliers, and managing selection processes.
	+ Support clients to structure, negotiate, and close corporate PPAs covering different pricing models, underlying scope (wind, solar, possibly co\\-located storage), and innovative contracting aspects.
	+ Advise on renewable certificate and carbon offset management.
* **Risk Management \\& Budget Oversight** :



	+ Advise on the energy risk management model (price volatility, regulatory shifts, supplier dependencies) and provide recommendations on hedging strategy and instruments.
	+ Strengthen (digital) capabilities to monitor, analyse, forecast and report on energy expenditures and performance against budget at the portfolio level, including energy \\& sustainability reporting needs.
* **Transformation \\& Digital Enablement** :



	+ Translate strategies into required operating model changes to enable their execution, covering processes, organization and governance, (digital) capabilities, data \\& insights. This includes sourcing external capabilities, e.g. through aggregators or flexibility service providers.
	+ Evaluate operating model options on value potential, risk sharing, and implementation cost, and design optimal operating model.
	+ Drive stakeholder alignment and effective change management.
	+ Advise on software capabilities, vendor selection, optimal stack, and integration of 3rd party software capabilities in the Energy Trading \\& Risk Management (ETRM) domain.

Around this scope of activities, you assume following key responsibilities:


* **Business \\& client development** :



	+ Evaluate client needs and market evolutions to identify client opportunities and potential new services.
	+ Support initial conversations with new target clients by providing expertise, sharing project experiences, and qualifying opportunities.
	+ Lead the development of (part of) the proposals related to your scope of activities.
	+ Build relationships at existing clients and on existing projects in order to identify and convert cross\\-selling opportunities.
* **Project delivery:**


	+ Lead projects or workstreams end\\-to\\-end covering project planning, progress management, risk \\& issue management, and project financials.
	+ Build trusted relationships with client stakeholders, manage stakeholder expectations, lead project communication, and perform change management.
	+ Lead the delivery process by defining the methodology and approach, guide the team on task execution, own the project deliverables and client recommendations, and oversee the work performed by Consultants and Analysts.
	+ Facilitate client workshops and steering group meetings.
* **People development:**


	+ Provide daily on\\-the\\-job coaching to project teams.
	+ Provide regular feedback to team members.
	+ Support recruiting of new talent through CV screening \\& interviewing and facilitate onboarding of new hires.
	+ Drive engagement and sense of belonging across the wider EEE team, and support talent retention actions.
	+ Line manager and mentor for Consultants and Analysts, and act as a role model.
* **Practice development:**


	+ Support the development of new offerings (e.g. multi\\-buyer PPA, flexibility proposition).
	+ Drive continuous improvement of methodologies, frameworks, and deliverables.
	+ Support the codification and management of (new) knowledge, and develop and conduct training programs.
	+ Conduct competitive assessments to improve our positioning and differentiation.
	+ Support definition and execution of a team hiring and development plan.
